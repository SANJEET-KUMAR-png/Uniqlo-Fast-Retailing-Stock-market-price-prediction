# Uniqlo-Fast-Retailing-Stock-market-price-prediction
  This project uses Uniqlo (Fast Retailing) stock market data from 2012–2017 to build predictive models for stock price forecasting.   
  The dataset includes columns — Date, Open, High, Low, Close, Volume, and Stock Trading. Data from 2012–2016 was used for training, 
  and 2017 data was used for testing. Comprehensive EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) and data preprocessing were performed to clean and 
  visualize trading patterns.

Models such as Linear Regression and XGBoost were trained to predict the closing price, and performance was evaluated using metrics like MSE,  R².

Python libraries used:
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly, time, and sklearn.
